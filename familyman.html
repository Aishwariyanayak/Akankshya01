<li>Movie Review: *The Family Man - It involves ideas of determinism and free will, as well as of psychological egoism.</li><br>
<li>*The Family Man;/* What a series! Mind blowing acting, screenplay! The last scene of the last episode, it sounds like another season will come surely.

The family man.</li><br>
<li>With a solid start to the drama,with every episode makes you heart beat faster. The rawness of the drama is surreal and gets you hooked. Every episode leaves you with a question unanswered? and doesn't answer them till the very last. Great acting by the whole cast.Not only do the "star" actors shine but the an amazing supporting cast make keeps you engaged.Lastly, Dont watch the first episode if you have your exam the next day or i promise you you will be locked in your room for 8 hours straight.</li><br>
<li>I believe i am the first person to complete the entire series and i am pretty sure i am in no position to go to the office right now. One thing about which i am very confident about is - Its one of the best Indian TV series so far. Amazing acting, Amazing direction, Super Amazing cinematography and what not.
It was worth watching in a single go. I was completely engaged in the storyline. I would personally recommend it. Its totally different and its very much unpredictable.
Good Job Team /\</li><br>
<li>Jack Ryan, which also happens to be an Amazon original used to be my favourite action/drama series until I saw this masterpiece. This series is very realistic and an exciting take on spy based series where the spy drives some old messed up hatchback and not an Aston Martin. The series also shows how the underpaid job of a spy affects Sri and his family. 10/10 would recommend. Doesn't matter which country you're from</li><br>
